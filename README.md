# Python All in One

### Basics
1. Hello World -> Very First Program.
2. Variables -> Integers, Floats, Strings.
3. List -> Used to store multiple items in a single variable.
4. Dictionary -> A changeable, unordered collection of unique key:value pairs. 
5. Tuple -> Collection which is ordered and unchangeable used to group together related data.
6. Set -> A Set in Python programming is an unordered, un-indexed collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.
7. Input -> Taking input from user.
8. Output -> Showing result/Print output.
9. Section (if, elif, else) -> A block of code that will execute if it's condition is true.
10. Function -> A block of code which is executed only when it is called.
11. Loops (for, while) -> A statement will execute its block of code.
12. Controls -> Change a loops execution from its normal sequence.
13. Modules -> A module can contain executable statements as well as function definitions.
14. Type Casting -> Convert the data type of value to another data.
15. String Slicing -> Create a substring by extracting elements from another string.
16. Logical Operators (and, or, not) -> "and, or" used to check if two or more conditional statements.
17. Index Operators [] -> Gives access to a sequence's element (str, list, tuples)
18. Return statement -> Functions send Python values/objects back to the caller.
19. String format -> Optional method that gives users more control when displaying output.
20. Exception -> Events detected during execution that interrupt the flow of program.
