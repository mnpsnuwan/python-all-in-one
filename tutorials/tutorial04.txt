Tutorial 4
Implement solutions for the following scenarios using Python.
1) A Student receives 2 marks at the end of each course. One is the exam mark and the
other is the special skills mark. If the exam mark is greater than 50 the student passes
the course and if he has more than 50 special skills points he receives a merit pass.
Design a function that takes the two marks and decides if itâ€™s a PASS, FAIL or MERIT
PASS result.
    e.g.:   > (merit 70 60)
            > MERIT PASS

2) Design a function that tests if
    a/. Two given numbers are both negative, otherwise say positive
    b/. At least one is negative
    e.g:    > (check-numbers 3 1)
            > Both are positive

            > (check-numbers -1 -4)
            > Both are negative

            > (check-numbers 8 -2)
            > One number is negative
