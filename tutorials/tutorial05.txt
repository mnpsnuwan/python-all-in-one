Tutorial 5
Implement solutions for the following scenarios using Python.
1. Design a function to decide if a given number is Even or Odd.
    e.g.:   >(OddEven 4)
            > 4 is Even

            >(OddEven 7)
            > 7 is Odd

2. Design a program to take 3 strings (e.g.: sentences or words), and output which string
was the longest and the number of characters in it.
    e.g.:   > Enter string 1: Hello World
            > Enter string 2: I’m learning Racket
            > Enter string 3: I’m also learning Python.
            > String 3 is the longest. It has 24 characters.
Improve the program by finding out the method where you can ignore the 'space'
characters. e.g.: 'Hello World' has 11 characters, but if you remove the space only 10
characters.
