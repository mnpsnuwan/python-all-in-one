Tutorial 9
Implement solutions for the following scenarios using Python.
1. Write a program that checks for Palindromes. A Palindrome is a word that when reversed
produces the same word.
    e.g.:
        > Enter a string: Kayak
        > “Kayak” is a Palindrome

        > Enter a string: Hello
        > “Hello” is not a Palindrome
